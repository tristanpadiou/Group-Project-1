Olympic Games Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project aims to explore various aspects of the Olympic Games using data analysis techniques. We focused on the correlation between a country's GDP and the number of medals won, the impact of hosting the games on medal counts, the influence of athletes' physical attributes on performance, and the changes in athlete participation over the years.

Guiding Questions

1. **Correlation between GDP and Medal Count**: Is there a correlation between a country’s GDP and the number of medals won at the Summer Olympic Games during the 1996 to 2020 period?
   
2. **Home Field Advantage**: Do countries in the Summer Olympics tend to win more medals when they host the Olympic Games?
   
3. **Impact of Physical Attributes**: What is the impact of height and weight on performance in the Men's 4 x 400m relay?
   
4. **Changes in Athlete Participation**: How has athlete participation in the Summer and Winter Olympic Games changed over the years?

Results

 **1. Correlation between GDP and Medal Count**:

 The analysis suggests there is some correlation between a country’s GDP and the number of medals won at the Summer Olympics. Higher GDP appears to be linked with higher medal counts, implying that wealthier countries might have better resources for athlete training and development. However, there are many more factors such as population and culture that also impact a countries olympic success.

**2. Home Field Advantage**

Our data indicates that countries tend to win more medals when they host the Summer Olympic games. Historical trends show that host countries like the USA (1904, 1932, 1984) experienced significant increases in their medal counts during the years they hosted. This pattern suggests a notable home field advantage, possibly due to familiar environments, supportive local crowds, and reduced travel fatigue for athletes. The USA’s medal trends in these years, with particularly high counts in 1904, exemplify this phenomenon.

**3. Impact of Physical Attributes**

Height and weight appear to play a role in the performance of athletes in the Men’s 4 x 400m relay. The analysis indicated that the highest density of medal winners ranged in height from 182 cm to 186 cm and in weight from 70 kg to 76 kg. This suggests that there might be an optimal physical profile for success in this event.

**4. Changes in Athlete Participation**:

Athlete participation in the Summer and Winter Olympic games has fluctuated over the years, influenced by various geopolitical events. For instance, the boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to a significant dip in participation. Such events highlight the sensitivity of the Olympics to global political climates, impacting the number and diversity of participating athletes. Despite these fluctuations, there has been an overall positive trend in athlete participation, reflecting the growing global interest and inclusivity of the Olympic Games.
